# Assessing the impact of endogenous Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) on bacetiral metabolism.
This project aimed to evaluate how endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulate the metabolism of *Pseudomonas putida* by integrating protein-level ROS susceptibility into a genome-scale metabolic model (GEM).

All stuff available here was used to obtain the results presented in my **Master's Final Work** (TFM in spanish): "Assessing the impact of endogenous Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) on bacterial metabolism".

## What can be found here?
- `scripts/` folder with all the **scripts** used in the project. It is divided into 4 main subdirectories:
  
  `Proteome_processing_monomers/` : codes used to annotate **structural markers of ROS susceptibility** in *P. putida* proteome's **monomers**.
  
  `Proteome_processing_multimers/` : codes for annotating **structural markers of ROS susceptibility** in *P. putida* proteome's **complexes** (not used in the TFM).
  
  `ROS_modelling/` : all codes and notebooks to evaluate the **effect of ROS on *P. putida* GEM**.
  
  `Stats_analysis/` : all codes to perform **statistical analyses**.

- `data/` folder with intermediate datasets and final **results**. 
- `supplementary_figures/` folder with **supplementary figures** $S2$ and $S3$ for the TFM.
