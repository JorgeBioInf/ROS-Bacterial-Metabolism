# Assessing the impact of endogenous Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) on bacetiral metabolism.
This project aimed to evaluate how endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulate the metabolism of *Pseudomonas putida* by integrating protein-level ROS susceptibility into a genome-scale metabolic model (GEM).

All stuff available here was used to obtain the results presented in my **Master's Final Work** (TFM in spanish): "Assessing the impact of endogenous Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) on bacterial metabolism"

## What can be found here?
- `scripts/` folder with all the **scripts** used in the project. It is divided into 4 main subdirectories: 
  1) `Proteome_processing_monomers` : codes used to annotate structural markers of ROS susceptibility in *P.putida* proteome's monomers
  2) `Proteome_processing_multimers` : codes for annotating structural markers of ROS susceptibility in *P.putida* proteome's complexes (not used in the TFM)
  3) `ROS_modelling` : all codes and notebooks to evaluate the effect of ROS on *P.putida* genome-scale-metabolism (GEM)
  4) `Stats_analysis` : all codes to perform statistical analysis

- `data/` folder with intermediate datasets and final **results**. 
- `supplementary_figures/` folder with **supplementary figures** for the TFM.
