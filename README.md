# ROS-Bacterial-Metabolism
This repository contains all scripts used in the workflow to assess the impact of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) on a given metabolism. 
All codes available here were used to obtain my TFM "Assessing the impact of endogenous Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) on bacterial metabolism"

The repository is divided into 4 main folders:
  1) Proteome_processing_monomers : codes used to annotate structural markers of ROS susceptibility in P.putida proteome's monomers
  2) Proteome_processing_multimers : codes for annotating structural markers of ROS susceptibility in P.putida proteome's complexes (not used in the TFM)
  3) ROS_modelling : all codes and notebooks to evaluate the effect of ROS on P.putida genome-scale-metabolism
  4) Stats_analysis : all codes to perform statistical analysis
