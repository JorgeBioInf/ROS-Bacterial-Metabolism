# Find structural features susceptible to ROS in complexes of *P. putida*
Here are stored all the scripts used to extract potentially **ROS-inhibitable structural features** present in **multimeric proteins**. 

The workflow to be followed can be found in the [monomer processing](../Proteome_processing_monomers) section.

Scripts are shared with the workflow for monomers. However, those scripts stored here ending in `"_FULL"` are adapted to process **monomers and multimers**.
