# Find structural features susceptible to ROS in monomeric proteins of *P. putida*
Here are stored all the scripts used to extract potentially **ROS-inhibitable structural features** present in **monomeric proteins**. Nevertheless, this workflow is adapted specifically to the proteome available in the **genomic-scale model iJN1480** of *P. putida*.

## Followed workflow
Each script's details can be found inside their source code

### 1. Proteome extraction and identification of proteins

1. `PP_metab_proc.py`: Extracts KEGG identifiers from GEM `iJN1480.txt` and processes them.
   1. **INPUT**
      - `iJN1480.txt`: GEM model
      - `(ID_relationships.json)`: optional dictionary with KEGG–UniProt identifiers relationship
